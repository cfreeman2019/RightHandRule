# RightHandRule

This program asks for input of direction for velocity, magnetic field, and force and asks you to answer true/false to whether this point charge is positive. If you input two of three of these directions as valid directions (up|down|left|right|in|out) and these two directions are not parallel or anti-parallel, the program will print a message that displays the direction of the unknown vector.  If you input all three vectors it will send a message to the user that there are no unknowns to find (it doesn't say whether this is a possible or impossible configuration). If only velocity and magnetic field are entered and they are either parallel or antiparallel it will print a message that says "Force is Zero". If velocity and force or force and magnetic field are parallel or anti-parallel it will print a message saying that this configuration is impossible.  After printing the result it will ask the user if they would like to run the program again.

In short this program takes the input for the direction of 2 vectors and prints the resultant direction of the third unkown vector.
